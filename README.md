# AI Problems

Welcome to the AI Problem Solvers repository! This project aims to tackle various interesting problems using artificial intelligence techniques. Each team member will be in charge of solving a specific problem and contributing to this repository.

## Introduction

In this repository, we explore different AI problems and provide solutions. Whether you’re interested in constraint satisfaction problems, game theory, or optimization, you’ll find something exciting here!

## Problem Descriptions

### 1. Solving Sudoku using Arc Consistency
- **Description:** Sudoku is a classic puzzle game where you need to fill a 9x9 grid with digits from 1 to 9, following certain rules.
- **Task:** Implement an algorithm that solves Sudoku puzzles using arc consistency.
- **Language:** Python (or any language of your choice).
- **Instructions:** Document your approach and provide clear instructions on how to run your code.

### 2. Tic-Tac-Toe using Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning
- **Description:** Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple game played on a 3x3 grid.
- **Task:** Implement a Tic-Tac-Toe game where the computer plays optimally using the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.
- **Language:** Python (or any language of your choice).
- **Instructions:** Document your code and provide instructions for running it.

### 3. Tic-Tac-Toe using Expectimax
- **Description:** Expectimax is an alternative to minimax that considers probabilistic outcomes.
- **Task:** Implement a Tic-Tac-Toe game where the computer uses expectimax instead of minimax.
- **Language:** Python (or any language of your choice).
- **Instructions:** Explain your approach and how expectimax works in your README.

### 4. The N-Queens Problem with an Improved Method
- **Description:** The N-Queens problem involves placing N chess queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.
- **Task:** Choose either “arc consistency” or “naked triples” to improve the solution.
- **Language:** Python (or any language of your choice).
- **Instructions:** Provide a clear explanation of your approach and any optimizations you’ve made.
